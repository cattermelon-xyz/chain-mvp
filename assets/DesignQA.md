# Q&A

1. `Should Enforcer be written in the chain config or should it be something else written outside of the chain?` It should be written outside of the chain *why?*.
2. `What benefit that decentraling this app bring to its creators?`

- **Security:** Decentralization make the code & the binary & the data public available; it will help increase the code quality and security just like how it helped open-source project.
- **Adoptation:** Decentralization make the program is easier to access to public since it create a network effect with the validator (token holder) community.
- **Functions:** Decentralization enable its user to move funds in other blockchain securely? *really, need to check*

3. `How connect to other chain works?`

- User simply use MetaMask, Phantom or whatever wallet at hand to sign transaction, send it to the chain (using js sdk). Nothing new must be installed at user device.

4. `When to call log.Fatal and terminate the program?`

- Never?
